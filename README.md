# LocationLog

This project, largely developed in 2021, is an iOS app to continuously track and record a user's own movements, and store this location information locally on the device

This project's public repository is complete except for the 'LocationManager.swift' file (which handles the Location Manager object for the app) so as to preserve intellectual property
